# M.ETH - Medical (Prescriptions) on Ethereum

In Italy, a lot of medical prescriptions are still hand written: electronic prescription are only required when the drug is paid by the regional public system, but every pharmaceutical drug that legally requires a medical prescription can still be bought with a hand-written prescription. This leads to an authenticity problem. Moreover, it is common practice that a pharmacist does not ask for medical prescription, even if it is needed. These behaviors cause a serious problem of drug use disorders among the population. This project has the aim of overcoming these kind of issues. 

This service consists in a blockchain application that authenticates medical prescriptions and facilitates the interoperability between medical doctors, pharmacies and authorities, creating an aggregate prescription-drugs-database in a secure way.

Prescriptions that are transmitted using the blockchain platform can be verified together with the identities of the medical doctor and the patient. Pharmacists would then be able to verify the authenticity of the prescription to ensure that they are selling a medicine for legitimate use. Finally, through a unique identification code for each drug, it would also be able to ensure that a prescription medicine is sold only and exclusively to those who have a valid prescription.

Blockchain would also overcome the issue of privacy for health data, as patient's information would be de-identified, so that only trusted viewers, in this case the medical doctor and the pharmacist once the request is made, can associate the record present in the blockchain with the patient that asks for the drug.
